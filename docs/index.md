# Observability Provider

Terraform Observability provider enables users to provision objects as resources and read types as data sources

## Authentication

To start using the Observability Terraform Provider you need to authenticate with the Cisco Observability Platform. 

You can do this by either using service-principal or oauth as an authentication method:


```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    observability = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/cisco-open/observability"
    }
  }
}

provider "observability" {
  tenant       = "<your cisco observability account>"
  auth_method  = "service-principal"
  url          = "https://<your environment/host>"
  secrets_file = "<path to your secrets file>"
}

```

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    observability = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/cisco-open/observability"
    }
  }
}

provider "observability" {
  tenant       = "<your cisco observability account>"
  auth_method  = "oauth"
  url          = "https://<your environment/host>"
}
```
